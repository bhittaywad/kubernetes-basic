# What is a Secret?
A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. Such information might otherwise be put in a Pod specification or in a container image. Using a Secret means that you donâ€™t need to include confidential data in your application code.

## Creating a Secret
You can create a Secret from a file, literal values, or with a YAML definition.

## Example: Creating a Secret from Literal Values
